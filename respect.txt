# THE BOOK OF RESPECT
Document Version: v0.1

=============================

This document outlines the sacred criteria, expectations, and threats tied to inclusion in `respect.txt`.

1. Inclusion is earned, not claimed. You do not "add" yourself — you are chosen.
2. Completion of The W.T.F. Developer Challenge without breaking a single rule qualifies you for review.
3. Submissions must include:
   - One (1) cursed pixel creation
   - Source code (must cause emotional damage)
   - A personal testimony describing your descent into madness

4. All submissions are judged by the original creator or whatever entity is brave enough to maintain this list.

5. Violators of the rules — especially those who:
   - Use `import pygame`
   - Automate rendering
   - Touch built-in drawing tools
   shall be cast into `disrespect.txt` permanently.

6. Any individual caught forging respect will be:
   - Exiled from the devverse
   - Marked with shame
   - Possibly memed in future updates

7. If your name disappears from this file, you are to remain silent. Forever.

8. **ONLY the original creator ("@NgQuangHuy106") has the absolute authority to add, remove, reject, or erase anyone from this file — at any time, for any reason.**
   Arguing this rule results in immediate disqualification and eternal invisibility.

RESPECTED DEVELOPERS:
(None yet.)

=============================

To be respected, you must first be broken.
