You may wonder why there's no example.py.

Because I made PAIN, not comfort.

This isn’t a game engine.
It’s a canvas — but one where you draw every pixel by hand.
Like a caveman with math knowledge and depression.

This module isn’t made to “help” your project.
It exists to make you suffer, and if you survive — you earn respect.

You’re not supposed to have fun here.
You’re supposed to build something from scratch and hate yourself a little less after.

Good luck.
